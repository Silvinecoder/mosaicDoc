    <h3>Overriding</h3>
    <p>
      This section will show where the overrides can be added in Mosaic. To find
      where we can add the overrides, we need to navigate to Site-wide Content,
      Footer, and Edit Footer:
    </p>
    <img src="../assets/img/Overrides/Override.png" alt="Override Code" />
    <p>
      In Region 4, the dev can add their overrides into the WYSIWYG source code.
      I recommend having a backup CSS or HTML file that the dev can copy and
      paste. Once the code is saved into the WYSIWYG field, it will be
      formatted, making it harder to read.
